## 👓Project Overview:

### 🎯Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to create a personalized movie recommendation system. The system utilizes both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest movies tailored to individual users' preferences.

### 🍽️Components:

#### 1. Collaborative Filtering System:

- **Algorithm:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is employed for collaborative filtering. This technique analyzes users' historical ratings to make personalized movie suggestions.
- **Implementation:** The Surprise library is used for collaborative filtering. The model is trained on a dataset containing user ratings.

#### 2. Content-Based Filtering System:

- **Approach:** Content-based filtering relies on movie attributes, such as genres and titles, to recommend similar items.
- **Implementation:** A TF-IDF vectorizer is used to convert movie genres and titles into numerical representations. Cosine similarity is then calculated to find movies with similar content.

### 🧑‍🏭Usage:

#### Collaborative Filtering:

1. The collaborative filtering system is trained on user ratings using the Surprise library.
2. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE are computed to assess the model's performance.
3. The trained model is then used to make personalized movie recommendations for a specific user.

#### Content-Based Filtering:

1. Movie genres and titles are preprocessed and converted into a TF-IDF matrix.
2. A function is implemented to recommend movies based on similarity to a given movie title.
3. Example recommendations are shown for specific genres or movies.

#### Hybrid Recommendation System:

- There's a mention of combining collaborative and content-based filtering. However, the actual hybrid system integration is not provided in the code snippet.

### 💻User Interaction:

- Users can input either a movie title or genre to receive personalized recommendations.
- An example of a user entering a movie title or genre and receiving relevant movie suggestions is demonstrated.

### 🧠Data Understanding:

- A section on "data understanding for the project" is mentioned but not provided. Understanding the dataset is crucial for effective recommendation systems.

### 🚒Deployment:

- A brief explanation of the deployment process is given, involving exporting models, setting up APIs, hosting, and integration into an application.

### 🗒️Additional Notes:

- There's a statement regarding the project's focus on enhancing user experience, satisfaction, and retention on a movie-streaming platform.
